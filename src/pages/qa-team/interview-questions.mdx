# Interview Questions

## Manual Testing

#### What do you test in QA?

- Usability
- Functionality
- Performance
- Security

#### What is the software testing life cycle? Explain each step in the detail.

1. Requirement analysis
2. Test planning
3. Test case development
4. Test execution
5. Closure

-- or --

1. Plan
2. Do
3. Check

#### Explain the different test levels of and give examples

Testing levels refer to the different stages and granularity of testing.

1. Unit testing
2. Integration testing
3. End to end testing

#### What is your approach to test planning?

Agile or Waterfall?

- Agile: Agile is meant to address the demand of higher iteration and deployment frequency.
- Waterfall: If a team only requires releasing new code every once in a while, say a month, then Waterfall sequential and linear testing would still make sense.

#### Give an example what kind of project you can do agile testing and which kind of project you can do waterfall testing.

#### What is stress testing?

Stress testing puts the application under extreme conditions beyond the normal operating parameters. It aims to identify the breaking point of the system and how it behaves when it reaches its limits.

#### What is load testing?

Load testing involves testing the application under varying levels of normal user load to determine how well the system can handle normal amounts of traffic. Load testing helps to identify performance bottlenecks, such as slow response times, high CPU usage, and memory leaks.

#### What is performance testing?

Performance testing evaluates the system's performance (i.e. responsiveness, scalability, stability, and speed) under varying workload conditions. Its goal is to determine how the application behaves under normal and peak usage scenarios, such as high user traffic, large data volumes, or simultaneous user interactions.

#### What is accessibility testing?

Accessibility testing is the process of evaluating a software application or website's usability for all users, including people with disabilities, such as visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive impairments. It tests the appâ€™s compatibility with assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and voice recognition software.

#### What is end to end testing? What is the difference between end to end testing and unit testing?

End-to-end testing evaluates the entire application flow from start to finish, to ensure that all integrated components of the software system work together as expected. Integration testing looks at how individual integrated components, from the API to UI, work.

#### What are the key components of a good test case?

#### Can you provide an example of a particularly challenging defect you have identified?

#### How do you ensure that test cases are comprehensive and cover all possible scenarios?

#### What is your approach to identifying and reporting defects?

#### What are test management tools?

#### What is the difference between software testing and quality assurance?

#### Why is quality assurance critical in software development?

## Automated Testing

#### What is your experience with automation testing tools?
